Annual Financial Statement (AF) 
This is a crucial document that highlights the receipts and expenditures of the government during the financial year. It is presented among the Budget documents in Parliament every year.

Consolidated Fund
All of the revenue raised by the government, market borrowings, and receipts from loans are part of the Consolidated Fund of India. All of the government's expenditure comes out of this fund, barring items met from the Contingency Fund or the Public Account. Money can only be withdrawn from this fund with prior Parliamentary approval.

Contingency Fund
This is a corpus set aside for any unforeseen events. The Contingency Fund is at the disposal of the President. Any money withdrawn from this fund, with prior approval of Parliament, is repaid from the Consolidated Fund.

Public Account 
This account contains the amount of money used for transactions where the government merely acts as a banker. All the money received by or on behalf of a central or state government is credited to this account. Simply put, this money does not belong to the government and is meant to be paid back at some time to their rightful owners. 

Inflation
The rate of increase in prices of goods and services is known as inflation. It can also be understood as the rate at which the power to purchase a defined set of goods and services weakens.

Direct taxes
These are taxes that are levied directly from taxpayers, such as income tax and corporate tax. These form one of the most important components of the Budget. 

Indirect taxes
These are taxes that are levied indirectly from taxpayers, such as GST, VAT, customs and excise duties, and service tax.

Fiscal policy
It is an essential instrument meant to monitor the domestic economic position. Simply put, an estimate of taxation and government spending is known as fiscal policy. 

Fiscal deficit
A fiscal deficit is a situation wherein the government’s expenditure exceeds its revenue, excluding market borrowings. Calculated as a percentage of the GDP, it is the gap between the government's total spending and the sum of its total receipts.

Finance Bill
It is a bill used by the government to propose the levy of new taxes, alterations in the tax structure, or even the continuance of the existing tax structure. 

Budget Estimate
These are a set of estimates of fiscal and revenue deficits for the next financial year. Simply put, Budget Estimates represent the monetary value assigned to the government's ambitions. 

Monetary policy
These are the various measures that are at the disposal of the central bank to regulate the level of flow of money in the economy and the banking system.

Divestment
The process of the sale of existing assets is known as disinvestment or divestment. Typically, it is meant to raise revenue or to pare losses from non-performing assets. 

Revenue receipt (expenditure)
A crucial portion of the Budget, the revenue receipt contains anything and everything that does not lead to the creation of assets, such as salaries, subsidies, and interest payments.

Revenue Deficit
A revenue deficit is a situation when the government’s total revenue expenditure exceeds its total revenue receipts. In simple terms, a revenue deficit means that the government is overspending from its regular income. 

Capital expenditure (capex)
The total amount of money that the government spends towards the development, acquisition, or degradation of machinery or assets.

Budget estimates of 2023-24 as compared to revised estimates of 2022-23
▪ Total Expenditure: The government is estimated to spend Rs 45,03,097 crore in 2023-24. This is an
increase of 7.5% over the revised estimate of 2022-23. Out of the total expenditure, revenue expenditure is
estimated to be Rs 35,02,136 crore (1.2% increase) and capital expenditure is estimated to be Rs 10,00,961
crore (37.4% increase). The increase in capital expenditure is due to an increase in capital outlay on
transport (including railways, roads and bridges, and inland water transport) by Rs 1,28,863 crore (36.1%
increase). Expenditure on total capital outlay is estimated to be Rs 8,37,127 crore in 2023-24, an increase of
35% over the revised estimates for 2022-23.
▪ Total Receipts: Government receipts (excluding borrowings) are estimated to be Rs 27,16,281 crore, an
increase of 11.7% over the revised estimates of 2022-23. The gap between these receipts and the
expenditure will be plugged by borrowings, budgeted to be Rs 17,86,816 crore, an increase of 1.8% over the
revised estimate of 2022-23.
▪ Transfer to states: The central government will transfer Rs 18,62,874 crore to states and union territories in
2023-24, an increase of 8.9% over the revised estimates of 2022-23. Transfer to states includes devolution
of Rs 10,21,448 crore out of the divisible pool of central taxes, grants worth Rs 6,86,773 crore, and special
loans worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore for capital expenditure.
▪ Deficits: Revenue deficit is targeted at 2.9% of GDP, and fiscal deficit is targeted at 5.9% of GDP in 2023-
24. The target for primary deficit (which is fiscal deficit excluding interest payments) in 2023-24 is 2.3% of
GDP. The revised estimate for the revenue deficit target has increased from the budgeted estimate in 2022-
23. The revised fiscal deficit target for 2022-23 has remained the same, despite higher receipts. In 2022-23,
the central government’s revenue deficit is expected to be 4.1% of GDP against a budget estimate of 3.8% of
GDP.
▪ GDP growth estimate: The nominal GDP is estimated to grow at a rate of 10.5% in 2023-24.
Defence: The Ministry of Defence has been allocated Rs 5,93,538 crore which is the largest across all ministries
and accounts for over 13% of the total expenditure of the central government. Over the last decade, the
expenditure of the Ministry as a percentage of GDP has reduced. In 2023-24, its allocation is estimated to be
marginally lower than 2% of GDP. Since 2014-15, the spending on defence pension has been consistently
higher than 20% of the total budget and capital outlay has remained below 30% of the budget.
Road Transport and Highways: The Ministry has been allocated Rs 2,70,435 crore, 25% higher than the
revised estimates of 2022-23. Most of the additional allocation (60%) has been earmarked for investment in
NHAI. Budgetary allocation has increased since NHAI will not borrow from the market. Construction of roads
is primarily done through public funds. Private investment constituted 7% of investment in roads in 2020-21.
Food and Public Distribution: Allocation for the Department in 2023-24 was 31% lower as compared to the
revised estimate of 2022-23. This was due to the discontinuation of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna
Yojana that was announced during the pandemic to provide free foodgrains to eligible beneficiaries. In 2023-
24, expenditure on food subsidy is estimated to be Rs 1.97 lakh crore. Updating the coverage of eligible
families is an issue as the total number of beneficiaries continues to be based on the 2011 Census.
Home Affairs: The Ministry has been allocated Rs 1,96,035 crore, an increase of 1.1% over the revised
estimates for 2022-23. Of the Ministry’s total budget, 65% of the expenditure is on police and 31% is on grants
to UTs. 74% of the expenditure on police has been allocated to the Central Armed Police. Issues in the sector
include shortages of police personnel and inadequate number of cybercrime cells. 24% of the Indo-Bangladesh
border remains unfenced.
Rural Development: The Ministry of Rural Development was allocated around Rs 1.6 lakh crore for 2023-24,
12% less than the revised estimates of 2022-23. This is largely due to the decrease in allocation towards the
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Rs 60,000 crore), which is 33% less than
revised estimate for 2022-23. Demand for work under MGNREGS could decrease this year, as the rural
economy returns to normal after the pandemic. Allocation towards rural housing increased by 13% in 2023-24,
while allocation towards rural roads remained unchanged.
Railways: In 2023-24, Railways is projected to have a marginal revenue surplus, which would fund less than
1% of its capital expenditure plan. 92% of capital expenditure will be funded by budgetary support from the
central government, and 7% from extra budgetary resources. The operating ratio (expenditures as proportionate
to traffic works receipts) is 98.5%, indicating limited surplus for capital investment.
Agriculture: The Ministry has been allocated Rs 1,25,036 crore in 2023-24, a 5% increase over the revised
estimates of 2022-23. 77% of the Ministry's estimated expenditure is towards three schemes that provide cash
transfer, interest subsidy, and crop insurance. The amount of institutional credit to farmers has risen (7.8% over
the past ten years), but loans are primarily being used to meet revenue expenditure in farming or recurring
household expenditure.
Education: In 2023-24, the estimated expenditure of the Ministry of Education is Rs 1,12,899 crore, a 13%
increase from revised estimates for 2022-23. Of this, the Department of School Education and Literacy has
been allocated 61% and the Department of Higher Education has been allocated the remaining 39%. 33% of the
Ministry’s budget has been allocated to Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan. Since 2015, overall allocation towards
education has been around 2.8% of the GDP.
Telecommunications: Rs 59,740 crore (56% of the allocation) in 2023-24 is towards the revival package for
BSNL and MTNL. No funds were disbursed under the PLI scheme in 2021-22. In 2022-23 also, no funds will
be spent towards this scheme as per revised estimates. Bharatnet and Network for Defence projects have seen
significant delays.
Jal Shakti: The Ministry of Jal Shakti was allocated Rs 97,278 crore for 2023-24, a 31% increase over the
revised estimates for 2022-23. The Jal Jeevan Mission received the highest allocation (Rs 70,000 crore). River
Interlinking saw an increase in allocation due to the implementation of the Ken-Betwa Link Project. Funds have
remained underutilised in schemes such as the Swachh Bharat Mission- Gramin, Atal Bhujal Yojana, and
Namami Gange.
Health and Family Welfare: In 2023-24, the expenditure of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is
estimated to be Rs 89,155 crore, a 13% increase from revised estimates for 2022-23. The National Health
Mission is its largest component, accounting for 33% of the Ministry's budget and medical colleges and
hospitals account for 27% of the budget. High out-of-pocket expenditure and shortage of healthcare personnel
remain major issues.
Housing and Urban Affairs: In 2023-24, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has been allocated Rs
76,432 crore, an increase of 2.5% over the revised estimates for 2022-23. The major items are urban housing
(PMAY-U) at Rs 25,103 crore and metro projects at Rs 23,175 crore. Several metro systems are not able to
generate required ridership to breakeven.
Petroleum and Natural Gas: The Ministry has been allocated Rs 41,008 crore, which is a 21% increase over
the revised estimates for 2022-23. This includes Rs 30,000 crore towards capital support to Oil Marketing
Companies via equity infusions. There has been a decrease in allocation towards the LPG subsidy and no
allocation has been made towards the kerosene subsidy. There has been an increase in capital outlay towards
the creation of caverns and purchase of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserves.
Women and Child Development: The Ministry has been allocated Rs 25,449 crore in 2023-24, a 6% increase
over the revised estimates of 2022-23. This is spent across three centrally sponsored schemes: Saksham
Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0, Mission Shakti, and Mission Vatsalya. In the past five years between 2016-17
and 2021-22, the Ministry has underutilised its funds.
Environment, Forests, and Climate Change: In 2023-24, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate
Change has been allocated Rs 3,079 crore, a 24% increase over the revised estimates of 2022-23. While India
has set targets to transition to renewable energy to tackle climate change, availability of adequate finance is a
key challenge. According to experts the overall cost required for India to adapt to climate change by 2030 is
expected to be around Rs 86 lakh crore (at 2012 base price).
Indirect taxes: The total indirect tax collections are estimated to be Rs 15,29,200 crore in 2023-24. Of
this, the government has estimated to raise Rs 9,56,600 crore from GST. Out of the total tax collections
under GST, 85% is expected to come from central GST (Rs 8,11,600 crore), and 15% from the GST
compensation cess (Rs 1,45,000 crore).
▪ Corporation tax: The collections from taxes on companies are expected to increase by 10.5% in 2023-24.
In 2022-23, corporate tax collection is expected to be 16% higher than the budget estimate (Rs 7,20,000
crore).
▪ Income tax: The collections from income tax are also expected to increase by 10.5% in 2023-24 to Rs
9,00,575 crore. Income tax collection is expected to be 16.4% higher than the budget estimate in 2022-23.
▪ Non-tax receipts: Non-tax revenue consists mainly of interest receipts on loans given by the centre, dividends,
license fees, tolls, and charges for government services. Dividend receipts were lower in 2022-23 than
originally budgeted mainly on account of lower dividend from Reserve Bank of India. In 2023-24, non-tax
revenue is expected to increase by 15% over the revised estimates of 2022-23.
▪ Disinvestment target: The disinvestment target for 2023-24 is Rs 51,000 crore. This is a marginal increase
of 2% over the revised estimate of 2022-23 (Rs 50,000 crore). In 2022-23, the receipts from disinvestment
are expected to be 23% lower than the budget estimate.
In 2023-24, the total expenditure on subsidies is estimated to be Rs 4,03,084 crore, a decrease of 28.3% from the
revised estimate of 2022-23 (Table 6).
▪ Food subsidy: Allocation to food subsidy is estimated at Rs 1,97,350 crore in 2023-24, a 31.3% decrease
over the revised estimate of 2022-23. A higher level of food subsidy was budgeted in 2021-22 and 2022-23
mainly on account of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, which provides for free additional
foodgrains to eligible beneficiaries to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. The provision of additional
foodgrains was discontinued in December 2022.
▪ Fertiliser subsidy: Expenditure on fertiliser subsidy is estimated at Rs 1,75,100 crore in 2023-24. This is a
decrease of Rs 50,120 crore (22.3%) from the revised estimate of 2022-23. Fertiliser subsidy for 2022-23
was increased substantially in response to a sharp increase in international prices of raw materials used in
the manufacturing of fertilisers.
▪ Other subsidies: Expenditure on other subsidies includes interest subsidies for various government
schemes, subsidies for the price support scheme for agricultural produce, and assistance to ship building
research and development, among others. In 2023-24, the expenditure on these other subsidies is estimated
to decrease by 30% over the revised estimate of 2022-23. 
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (rural and urban components taken together) has the highest allocation in
2023-24 at Rs 79,590 crore. This is an increase of 3.2% over the revised estimate of 2022-23. As
compared to the revised estimates of 2022-23, the allocation for the rural component of the scheme has
increased by 13% and the urban component has declined by 13% in 2023-24. For 2022-23, the allocation
towards the scheme has been increased by 60.7% as compared to the budget estimates.
▪ The Jal Jeevan Mission has the second highest allocation in 2023-24 at Rs 70,000 crore, an increase of
27.3% over the revised estimate of Rs 55,000 crore in 2022-23.
▪ Allocation for PM-KISAN has been kept constant at Rs 60,000 crore, and for MGNREGS has been reduced
by 33% to Rs 60,000 crore.
▪ Some other schemes with a comparatively higher increase in allocation in 2023-24 include: (i) Reform
Linked Distribution Scheme (101.2%), (ii) Swachh Bharat Mission (74.2%), and (iii) Guarantee Emergency
Credit Line to MSME borrowers (34.3%).

Anticipated gross and net market borrowings through dated securities during 2024-25 are INR 14.13 trillion (US$183.69 billion) and INR 11.75 trillion (US$152.75 billion), respectively, both lower than the figures for 2023-24. With significant private investments expected, the reduced borrowings by the central government are poised to improve credit availability for the private sector.
